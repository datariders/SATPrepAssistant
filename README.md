# Background
The [Scholastic Assessment Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT)is an entrance exam used by most colleges and universities in the USA to make admissions decisions. The SAT is a multiple-choice, computer-based test created and administered by the College Board. The [purpose](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-information) of the SAT is to measure a high school student's readiness for college, and provide colleges with one common data point that can be used to compare all applicants.

There are two sections in the SAT exam:
1. Math
2. English (Evidence-Based Reading and Writing)

Exams involving multiple choice questions require lots of practice.  SAT preparation boot camps and mock exams would immensely benefit students.

>>> Not all high school students of the nation may be able to afford SAT preparation boot camps and mock exams.
